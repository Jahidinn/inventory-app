## About Iventory App

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. In this project, I will create an inventory application to manage data as follows:

-   Add item data
-   Edit and delete item data
-   Add supplier data
-   View item stock details
-   Set item category
-   Set units of goods

-   Add incoming goods data input
-   Manage outgoing data

-   Data recap

## The components used to create the application

-   Laravel V10
-   Bootstrap V5
-   CSS
-   Javascript
-   JQuery
-   Font-Awesome
-   MySQL Database
